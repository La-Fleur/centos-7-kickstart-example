### Centos 7 Kickstart file example

I got tired looking for examples for ks files in anaconda

This file includes several examples that are missing and is best suited for virtual computer

- example of extra repos configuration
- the most basic configuration of disks (no lvm etc)
- updated kernel-ml from elrepo-kernel from first boot
- some basic (mostly vagrant-related post installation tasks)
